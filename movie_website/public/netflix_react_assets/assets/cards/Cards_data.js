        review:"Jack Black as Po in the Kung Fu Panda movies is one of the great voice performances of the 21st century, it has to be said. Black's strong, malleable voice, effortless comedic style and endless array of goofs and gags have made him a fan favourite. Therefore, when Netflix announced that Black was returning to his famous role for the sequel series Kung Fu Panda: The Dragon Knight, expectations were understandably high. The previous two series in the franchise had not, after all, featured Black even in a cameo.",
